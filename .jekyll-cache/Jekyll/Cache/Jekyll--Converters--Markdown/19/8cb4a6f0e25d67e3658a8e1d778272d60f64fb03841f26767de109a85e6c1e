<p>Prime number spirals are visualizations of the distribution of prime numbers that underscore their frequent occurrences
along certain polynomials. Theyâ€™re conceptually simple, yet create order out of the apparent chaos of primes and are
fairly beautiful. Weâ€™ll explore the Ulam and Sacks spirals, some of their underlying theory,
and algorithms to render each.</p>
