<h1 id="power-sets">power sets</h1>
<p>The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets, or a collection of all the different combinations of items
contained in that given set: in this write-up, weâ€™ll briefly explore the math behind power sets, and derive and compare
three different algorithms used to generate them.</p>

<h2 id="sets-primer">sets: primer</h2>
<p>To refresh our memories: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">set</a>, the building block of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set
theory</a><sup id="link1"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>, is a collection of any number of
unique objects whose order does not matter. A set is expressed using bracket notation, like \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), and an
empty, or <strong>null</strong>, set is represented using either of \(\emptyset\) and \(\{\}\). Because sets are order-agnostic, we
can say that the \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(\{3, 1, 2\}\) are equal, and, because they contain only distinct members,
something like \(\{1, 1, 2\}\) is invalid.</p>

<h2 id="subsets-and-the-power-set">subsets and the power set</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset">subset</a> of a set is any combination (the null set included) of its members,
such that it is contained inside the superset; \(\{a, b\}\), then, is a subset of \(\{a, b, c\}\), while \(\{a, d\}\)
is not. If a subset contains <em>all</em> of the members of the parent set (ie, itâ€™s a copy), we call it an <strong>improper</strong>
subset â€“ otherwise, itâ€™s <strong>proper</strong>. Finally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set">power set</a> of a set is the
collection of all of its subsets, so the power set of \(\{a, b, c\}\) is:</p>

\[\{
    \{\},
    \{a\},
    \{b\},
    \{c\},
    \{a, b\},
    \{a, c\},
    \{b, c\},
    \{a, b, c\}
\}\]

<p>Below is a test with Rouge:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="note1"><a href="#link1">1</a></span>: (completely tangentially) whenever I mention set theory I canâ€™t help but think of
the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a>: a staggering, three-volume
attempt to axiomatize all of mathematics, published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand
Russell</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead">Alfred North
Whitehead</a> in 1910-â€˜13, that relied heavily on sets. Itâ€™s
notorious, amongst other things, for proving \(1 + 1 = 2\) in no less than 379 pages. Check it out.</p>
