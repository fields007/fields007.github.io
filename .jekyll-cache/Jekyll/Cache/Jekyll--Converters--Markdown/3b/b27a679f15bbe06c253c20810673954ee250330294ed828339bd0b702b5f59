<p>I recently stumbled across a practical use-case for simulated exceptions in C while writing a recursive-descent JSON
parser for fun and profit. In this quick write-up, Iâ€™ll give a high-level overview of the problems that I ran into, why
exceptions were ideal for error handling, and how I emulated them in C.</p>
