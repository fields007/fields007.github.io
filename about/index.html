      This website is a personal space where I share work, notes, projects, and ideas. The main content appears in the articles section. Having studied mathematical physics and being passionate about it, much of the content comes from maths and physics, including projects developed during my studies, such as my theses. The discussion is often mathematical, but I also share simulations and projects that I particularly enjoyed working on.

              Hi! I'm Jan Masák. I study mathematical physics at the Czech Technical University in Prague, a field I've greatly enjoyed. I'm particularly drawn to abstract mathematical ideas and their applications in physics and related areas. I've also spent a lot of time teaching, which I find very rewarding, and I enjoy programming and electronics as well.
