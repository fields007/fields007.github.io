# power sets
The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets, or a collection of all the different combinations of items
contained in that given set: in this write-up, we'll briefly explore the math behind power sets, and derive and compare
three different algorithms used to generate them.

## sets: primer
To refresh our memories: a [set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)), the building block of [set
theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)<sup id="link1">[1](#note1)</sup>, is a collection of any number of
unique objects whose order does not matter. A set is expressed using bracket notation, like $$\{1, 2, 3\}$$, and an
empty, or **null**, set is represented using either of $$\emptyset$$ and $$\{\}$$. Because sets are order-agnostic, we
can say that the $$\{1, 2, 3\}$$ and $$\{3, 1, 2\}$$ are equal, and, because they contain only distinct members,
something like $$\{1, 1, 2\}$$ is invalid.

## subsets and the power set
The [subset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of a set is any combination (the null set included) of its members,
such that it is contained inside the superset; $$\{a, b\}$$, then, is a subset of $$\{a, b, c\}$$, while $$\{a, d\}$$
is not. If a subset contains *all* of the members of the parent set (ie, it's a copy), we call it an **improper**
subset -- otherwise, it's **proper**. Finally, the [power set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set) of a set is the
collection of all of its subsets, so the power set of $$\{a, b, c\}$$ is:

$$
\{
    \{\},
    \{a\},
    \{b\},
    \{c\},
    \{a, b\},
    \{a, c\},
    \{b, c\},
    \{a, b, c\}
\}
$$

Below is a test with Rouge:

```ruby
def hello
  puts "Hello, world!"
end
```

<span id="note1">[1](#link1)</span>: (completely tangentially) whenever I mention set theory I can't help but think of
the infamous [Principia Mathematica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica): a staggering, three-volume
attempt to axiomatize all of mathematics, published by [Bertrand
Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) and [Alfred North
Whitehead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead) in 1910-'13, that relied heavily on sets. It's
notorious, amongst other things, for proving $$1 + 1 = 2$$ in no less than 379 pages. Check it out.
